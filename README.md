## Thesis on social network between doctor and patient for the handling and management of personal medical documentation

> Development of a multiplatform application with the aim of streamlining and clarifying all medical issues that occur between a doctor and a patient, keeping within a friendly graphical interface (UI) where the user can have all documents, whether analysis, result, among others, within a user-friendly manner. organized giving the opportunity to link documents with their corresponding doctors.

#### Within the relational section of doctors we will establish different guidelines.

    Being able to share different information by the patient directly with the doctor in question through different communication platforms, this in case the doctor is not registered as a doctor within the application, in case said doctor already has an account Within the application, he will be able to see said information within the patients whom he has verified that he is his doctor, on the other hand, the patient will also be able to share the information with the doctors who are <b>"personal doctors" </b> directly from the application being highlighted the information within the application either on the web or mobile platform.
  </div>

## Platforms on which the application is developed.

- Web Project

  - <div align="justify">
      The web project is developed with the <b>NextJS</b> framework written in the <b>Javascript</b> programming language divided into the Client and Server architecture with the intention of keeping both architectures within the same project. with a solid code base, on the server side it is configured through <b>Express</b> with an automatic routes engine which are previously linked to the <b>Pages</b> directory within the draft. On the client side, it is directly based on the <b>React</b> framework, allowing scalability and separation of components in a clear and concise manner. Within the README.md of the web project, all the procedures and use of the same are specified in a more technical way.
    </div>
    <br>

- Mobile Project

  - <div align="justify">
      The mobile project is developed in the <b>Kotlin</b> programming language, designed and written entirely under the <b>Android Studio</b> environment. Within the mobile application there is the same graphical interface which is found within the web project by the client. Within the README.md of the mobile project, all the procedures and use of the same are specified in a more technical way.
